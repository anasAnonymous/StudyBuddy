### **Core Features**  

1. **Professor Persona Implementation**  
   - **Goal**: Simulate a professor persona tailored for different domains.  
   - **Approach**:  
     - Assign domain-specific roles to the AI bot via prompts when interacting with Gemini Flash 2.0 API.  
     - Example prompt for cybersecurity:  
       ```plaintext  
       "You are a cybersecurity professor with 10+ years of experience. Your task is to explain cybersecurity concepts in [comprehension level] with a [tone] style. Keep responses [content length]."  
       ```  
     - **Persona Customization**:  
       - **Professor Profiles**: Add different professor profiles for each domain with names, avatars, and brief descriptions.  
       - **Avatars**: Use illustrations or AI-generated avatars representing friendly professors with domain-specific symbols (e.g., shield for cybersecurity, dollar sign for finance).

### **Discussion Points for the Team Meeting**  

1. **Assigning Professor Roles**  
   - How should we structure prompts for each domain?  
   - Should we offer a single professor persona or multiple selectable ones?

   - Should we allow users to add personal notes to flashcards?  
3. **PDF Export Feature**  
   - How do we ensure proper formatting for exported PDFs?  
   - Should we include the professorâ€™s avatar and persona details in the export?
